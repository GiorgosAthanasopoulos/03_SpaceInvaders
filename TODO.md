# Goals
- (Animated) Sprites
- Try to create my own music/sfx?
- Particle effects for when things explode?

# TODO
## Aliens
- [ ] Create a few different types of alien invaders.
- [ ] Enemies will move together in a grid. They cross the screen horizontally before dropping vertically and reversing their direction.
- [ ] Add bombs/bullets that the enemies drop. 
- [ ] The invader bullets will destroy the player.
- [ ] Add a mothership that will cross the screen periodically. Destroying it will result in bonus points.

## Bunkers
- [ ] The original game had bunkers that alien bombs and player rockets would slowly destroy.
    - create multiple textures depending on life state, and alternate between them

## Particle FX
- [ ] Have fun with particle effects! You arenâ€™t restricted to the original hardware, so feel free to add as much game juice (particles, sounds, screen shake) as possible.

# Bugs
## Particles 
- They spawn but not show up

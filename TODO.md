# TODOs
## Aliens
- Add a mothership that will cross the screen periodically. Destroying it will result in bonus points.
    - check if the aliens have gone past a certain y point first so that the mothership can move in its own horizontal lane in the top.

# Bugs
## Player
- When hit by a bullet/bomb you sometimes lose 2 lifes instead of 1
